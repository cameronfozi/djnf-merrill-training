    "The Associated Press [reported](https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2024/05/23/naacp-fund-seeks-to-close-black-voter-registration-and-turnout-gaps-ahead-of-the-november-election/) in May the NAACP had made attempts at increasing voter registration among Black adults. Local News Matters, the nonprofit publication of Bay City News, [reported](https://localnewsmatters.org/2023/08/30/bay-areas-young-voters-are-registering-at-lower-rates-organizers-are-combating-this-ahead-of-2024-election/) in 2023 that young voters that year were registering at lower rates than they did in 2021.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2022, the NAACP asked the Alameda County Registrar of Voters to recount the votes from the mayoral election in Oakland. According to CBS News Bay Area, the registrar charged the organization $21,000 for each day the registrar recounted the votes; the NAACP called it voter suppression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, youth organizations in San Francisco have multiple times [attempted](https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/sf-youth-3rd-attempt-lower-voting-age-16-years-old-city-elections/) to lower the voting age in school board elections to 16. And in 2020, Oakland youth [succeeded](https://oaklandside.org/2023/08/28/oakland-youth-vote-measure-qq-2024-school-board-election/). Earlier in 2016, the passage of San Francisco's Proposition N [granted](https://www.sf.gov/news/voting-school-board-elections) noncitizen parents the right to vote in municipal school board elections.\n",
    "\n",
    "By reporting on demographic disparities in voter turnout, Bay City News and Local News Matters could serve an apparent interest in voting dynamics in  communities, but also fill a large void in coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of the preliminary data analysis required for a story on racial and socioeconomic disparities in voter turnout in the Bay Area is complete. But little has been done to explain why this is the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data may come to life following interviews with voter-turnout experts and Bay Area residents. With a wealth of academics and social-justice organizations in the region, this story would draw on a large pool of potential sources ready to speak on voter trends in the region."

    "While this analysis had originally planned to use the census block as a unit of analysis, there were about 700 census blocks of Alameda County’s approximately 18,500 for which there were no residents or the number of voters exceeded the number of voting-age residents, as recorded by the 2022 American Community Survey. Another avenue of exploration could use data from the 2020 decennial census, which are potentially more accurate, and compare them to voter turnout rates from the 2020 general election. <br> <br>\n",
    "**3. Average distance from a voting precinct**<br>\n",
    "California has voting-day registration. Say, if someone was not registered to vote the day of an election, how easy would it be for them to register and vote that day? One potential metric for this would be calculating the average distance as the crow flies between all addresses in a census tract and the location of the voting precinct. This analysis  may assume the distance from one's home to a voting precinct is a factor in people's willingness to vote. However, it appears many urban, walkable areas still have abysmal voter turnout, and sprawling, suburban areas have high voter turnout."
